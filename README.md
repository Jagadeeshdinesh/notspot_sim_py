# Notspot robot Gazebo simulation
This repository contains all the code and files needed to simulate the notspot quadrupedal robot using Gazebo and ROS.

This code has been tested on ROS noetic, so it might not work for other ROS versions.

If you happend to have problems with importing the Transformations module, make sure that the python folder RoboticsUtilities (notspot_sim/src/notspot_controller/scripts/RoboticsUtilities) is somewhere, from where python3 can import it. You can copy this folder together with all the files which is contains to this path: ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
